## Accessory Design Philosophy

Our accessories follow these design principles:

1. **Meaningful Impact** - Each accessory provides substantial benefits
2. **Strategic Choices** - Forces players to make interesting decisions about accessory loadouts
3. **Material Theme** - Uses materials that make sense for the effect (honeycomb for defense)
4. **Progression Appropriate** - Available when the effects are most useful

## Accessory Slots and Planning

Terraria limits the number of accessory slots available to players:

- Early game: 2 slots
- Mid-game: 3-4 slots
- Hardmode: 5 slots
- Late hardmode: 5-6 slots (with Master Mode/Expert Mode items)

When planning your loadout, consider how the Studded Honeycomb's +10 defense compares to other accessories you might equip.

## Upcoming Accessories

Future updates will include:
- Movement accessories
- Combat-focused accessories
- Class-specific accessories
- Hybrid accessories with multiple effects
